// add individual rotation functions - completed
// get buttons to show and not overlap - completed by putting within a div
// fix x move left/right, y move up/down - completed
// fix rotation buttons to register changes to x, y, z as well
//// from start (1) - x moves to 6, y moves to 4, z rotates to the right
///// x should also change y,z
/////// x should always bring bottom side up
///// y should also change x,z
/////// y should always bring left side right
///// z should also change x,y
/////// y should always rotate current side clockwise
// fix how y, z degrees interact on certain faces
//// faces 1 and 3 work fine, 
//// issue with faces, 2/4/5/6
